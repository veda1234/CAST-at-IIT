# **C**ontamination **A**ssessment and **S**ite management **T**ool (**CAST**)
------------------------

**CAST** provides an online application for the assessment of contaminated sites, specially for BTEX-type contaminations. The specific highlight is a web-based application for calculating steady-state plume length $L_{max}$ using [MODFLOW](http://tiny.cc/kon6jz) and [MT3D-MS](http://tiny.cc/6pn6jz).

**The site can be assessed from www.cast.iitd.ac.in **

**NOTE:**
_Authors and organizations credited on this page or on the above-mentioned website are NOT responsible for any results or output obtained from using the website or the codes provided here_

[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) micro web-framework is used for the web-application development. The front end has been designed using HTML, CSS and bootstrap, the back-end is being handled by the open source management system, MySQL and Python(3.6.8). The application currently can already be used for:


1. **Statistical Analysis of Contaminated sites:**
   * Large contaminated site database
   * Statistical measures and visualizations of important site quantities


2. **Analytical Models for steady-state plume length $(L_{max})$ estimations:**
    * 2D Vertical Model (Liedl et al., 2005)
    * 2D Horizontal Model (Ham et al. 2005, Chu et al., 2005)
    * 3D Model (Liedl et al., 2011)
    * More to be added ...,


3. **Empirical Models for $L_{max}$ estimations:**
   * 2D Vertical (Maier and Grathwohl, 2005)
   * 2D Vertical with richarge (Birla et al. 2019 - in revision)
   * More to be added ...,

4. **Numerical Models for plume length estimations:**
    * Web-interface for MODFLOW/MT3DMS
    * Single reactant reactive transport model based on Yadav et al., 2013.
    * More in the development ...,

5.  **Decision model for selection of model for site-assessment**
    * Based on Yadav et al., 2020 (in revision)
